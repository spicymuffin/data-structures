inclusivity of midpoint check should affect only midpoint choosing code.
direction of sign changes nothing except if and else block's content's order.
ascending/descending order changes only sign direction.
(assuming it's not a negation: for descending, x <; for ascending: x >)
(true sets left, false sets right)
checking left==right makes sure the search algorithm works even when n=0
